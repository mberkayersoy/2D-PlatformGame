# 2D-PlatformGame
I'm developing a 2D online platform game. In this game there will be 2 teams and the teams will fight each other. Random weapons will spawn in random places on the platforms. Weapons will also change according to the map. Each map will have its own feature that tries to kill players. The team with the most points at the end of the time will win.
